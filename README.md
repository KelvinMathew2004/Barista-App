# ☕ On My Grind!

**On My Grind** is a React-based memory quiz app inspired by Wordle and your local Starbucks! Test your barista skills by identifying the correct combination of drink temperature, flavor, milk type, and whether it's blended — all based on a random Starbucks drink.

Think you can handle the 8 AM rush?

## 🧠 Overview

In this app, you’ll quiz yourself on the specific recipe details of a Starbucks drink — including its **temperature**, **flavor**, **milk**, and **blendedness**. You'll select your answers through a form, and then get instant feedback on whether you're a master barista or need more grind time.

Whether it's a fan favorite or a discontinued classic, there's always another drink waiting for you to memorize.
